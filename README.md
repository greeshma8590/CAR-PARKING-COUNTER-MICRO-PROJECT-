# CAR-PARKING-COUNTER-MICRO-PROJECT-
# ðŸš— Car Parking Counter

A basic electronic system that counts the number of vehicles in a parking lot using infrared (IR) sensors and digital components like counters, adders, and display decoders.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Car Parking Counter project is designed to detect and count vehicles entering and exiting a parking area. The system uses IR sensors placed at the entrance and exit, processes the signals through digital logic, and displays the current count on a 7-segment display.

This project aims to improve parking space management and can be extended to other counting applications such as storage counters, footfall monitors, and currency counters.

## âš™ Components Used

* IR Sensors (Entrance & Exit)
* 7-Segment Display
* 7-Segment Display Decoder IC
* Full Adder IC (74LS83)
* Binary Counter IC
* Veroboard
* Jumper Wires
* Battery (Power Supply)

## ðŸ›  How It Works

* When a vehicle enters, an IR sensor detects its presence and sends a signal to the counter circuit.
* The counter increments the count, and this is displayed on the 7-segment display.
* When a vehicle exits, a different IR sensor sends a signal to subtract one from the count.
* The updated count is decoded and displayed in real-time.
* The logic mimics simple arithmetic using digital electronics: addition on entry and subtraction on exit.

## ðŸ§  Learning Outcomes

* Integration of sensors with digital components.
* Real-time event counting and display using hardware.
* Understanding of full adders, counters, and display decoders.
* Circuit design and hardware implementation of a practical system.
